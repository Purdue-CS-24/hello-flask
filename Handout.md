# Intro to Web Programming

# Summary

In this session, we will go over the basics of HTML and CSS to learn how to build websites from scratch. We will then look at a popular web framework, Flask, so that we can host our website and create dynamic web applications.

# Prerequisites

Please complete the following tasks before attending the workshop.

1. [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if not installed already
    - macOS and most Linux OS's should come with `python3` pre-installed, but you may want to install a newer version
2. [Read some of the basics of HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) if you are unfamiliar with it
